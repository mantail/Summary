NOTE: The date system uses midnight as time boundaries. Eg, starting at 11/21/9999 and ending at 11/21/9999 selects the full day of 11/21 as the meeting window, 11/21/9999-11/25/9999 selects the entirety of 11/21, 11/22, 11/23, 11/24, and 11/25 as the meeting window.<br>
NOTE: If you don’t know Number of Attendees in advance, input -1 to create a group of indeterminate size.
A group of indeterminate size has no way to automatically calculate meeting times, so the user MUST use the method described in ‘Selecting a time without all responses’ to get final results.<br>
